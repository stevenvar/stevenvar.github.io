				<p>
					My name is Steven Varoumas, I am a PhD graduate 👨🏻‍🎓 in Computer Science from <a
						href="http://www.sorbonne-universite.fr/en">Sorbonne University</a> in Paris, France.
				</p>
				<p>
					From a young age, I have been quite fascinated with computers, and I am now fond of <b>functional
						programming</b> (OCaml 🐫, Haskell, Erlang, ...), and well-versed in object-oriented and
					imperative programming languages (Java, C/C++, Python ...). I also have high interests and
					expertise in <b>embedded software</b> programming, <b>compilers</b> implementation, theorem proving
					and model
					checking.
				</p>

				<p>
					My PhD thesis was about
					<b>microcontrollers</b>/embedded systems programming, for which I was interested in using
					<b>high-level
						programming paradigms</b> that would be adapted to the scarce resources of such devices, while
					providing a
					more expressive and safer model than traditional C/assembly languages often used to program embedded
					systems. This work led me to create an implementation of <a
						href="https://github.com/stevenvar/OMicroB">an OCaml <b>virtual machine</b></a> that was able to
					run
					non-trivial programs written in a multiparadigm programming language on various microcontrollers
					with
					less than 8 kB or RAM. I also developed <a href="https://github.com/stevenvar/OCaLustre">a
						<b>synchronous programming</b>
						extension</a> to the OCaml language which further improves the safety and expressivity of the
					concurrent aspects of an embedded system. During my PhD thesis, I also highly enjoyed teaching
					university students multiple topics of computer science, from compilers to functional programming,
					concurrency, algorithms, and theorem proving.
				</p>

				<p> The manuscript of my thesis (just in French for now) and a list of my publications and talks are
					accessible on the <a href="research.html">research section</a> of this website.
				</p>

				<p>
					I was born-and-raised in a small town in <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troyes">a small
						town</a>
					in eastern France 🇫🇷, and
					lived in Paris for about 10 years, where I enjoyed the big city life and opportunities to meet with
					great scientists during my PhD.
					I then moved to the UK 🇬🇧 where I first worked in 2019-2020 as a Research Associate in the <a
						href="https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/">School of Computing</a> of the <a
						href=https://www.kent.ac.uk />University of Kent</a> (Canterbury, England) on the development of
					<a href="https://trustworthy-refactoring.gitlab.io/refactorer/">ROTOR</a>, a formally proven
					refactoring
					tool for OCaml programs.
					I am currently, since January 2021, a Compiler Engineer at Huawei Technologies Research &
					Development
					UK, in Cambridge.
